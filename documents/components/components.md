## Alinma Pay Mobile UI Components

This document provides a collection of fundamental building blocks for creating a consistent and user-friendly mobile app interface. These components are designed for optimal performance on mobile app and adhere to the Alinma Pay design system.

## **Component Categories:**

The components are categorized into three main groups:

1. **Visual Elements:** These components focus on displaying information without interactivity.
2. **Interactive Elements:** These components allow users to interact with the app and trigger actions.
3. **Containers:** These components group related visual and interactive elements to structure the app's layout.

**Components List:**

Each component entry includes:

- **Name:** A clear and concise name for the component.
- **Description:** A brief explanation of the component's purpose and functionality.
- **Figma Link (Optional):** A link to the component in your Figma design system file (if applicable).
- **Image:** A representative image showcasing the component's appearance (replace with image filenames).
- **Additional Notes (Optional):** For specific components, include details about variations or use cases.




### [Atoms](/docs/components/atoms.md)  
  -  Atoms are the smallest building blocks of a user interface. They can be native or third-party components, and they include basic elements like buttons, inputs, and text styles. Atoms should be simple and self-contained, with no dependencies on other components.

### [Molecules](/docs/components/molecules.md)  
  -  Molecules are groups of atoms that work together to perform a specific function. They are slightly more complex than atoms, and they can include multiple atoms within them. For example, a molecule might be a search bar, which includes an input field (atom) and a search button (atom).


### [Organisms](/docs/components/organisms.md)  
  -  Organisms are complex entities composed of molecules and/or atoms. They are the largest and most complex components in a design system, and they can be made up of one or more organisms. For example, a navigation bar might be an organism, as it includes multiple buttons (atoms) and possibly a search bar (molecule).
